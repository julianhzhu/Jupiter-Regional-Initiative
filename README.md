# Jupiter Regional Initiative

As Jupiter grows, we want to harness the power of community to further expand the Jupiverse -- user base, DAO participants and core community (catdets).

If you are hardworking, talented and have the heart for growing the community and helping people form bonds with each other, we want to work with you.

Let's build the best community together!
